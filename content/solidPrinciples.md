## SOLID Principles
Some important point about SOLID design principles.
- Generally speaking, SOLID state of matter can be brittle. But while talking about code we are not aiming for brittleness of code.
- As far as software designing is concerned, SOLID should be used where code can change shape.
- SOLID can come to rescue when all the requirements are not upfront while developing code.
- SOLID is not a framework
- SOLID is not a library.It is not technology bound. It is not pattern.
- Most of the code written today, though they are written in object oriented way but they are not object oriented and more or less procedural. Writing code in OO language is not a guarantee that the code will be OO.
- But we can make our code OO by using solid principles.We can more productive by using SOLID.
- Code is more maintainable and understandable.When code su er from design smell then SOLID is answer.

SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help software developers design maintainable and extendable classes.

- [Open-closed](./solidOpen.md)
- [Liskov substitution](./solidLiskov.md)
- [Interface segregation](./solidInterface.md)
- [Dependency inversion](./solidDependency.md)

As Uncle Bob says: _“They are not laws. They are not perfect truths”. Nevertheless, they have helped me a lot to create clean code, and I think as a developer you should at least know them so you can decide when to apply them and when not."_
