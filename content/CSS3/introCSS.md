## Cascading Style Sheet(CSS)

___CSS is a layout and formatting language that enables you to format markup languages such as HTML. Ideally the HTML document contains only semantic information and, with CSS, these will be formatted formatively and typographically.___

CSS is a programming language often used with HTML. It is used by programmers to change the way HTML elements look when they’re displayed in your browser. CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets and is sometimes called “style sheets” or “styles”. You can use CSS to change the design of your page by adding colours or changing the size and shape of HTML elements. You can also use CSS to change where things are positioned.

To use CSS to change a HTML element you can add a style attribute to your opening HTML tag. You can use the style attribute with any HTML tag.
```html
<p style="CSS-property: value;">The Monk Diamond had been hidden in a cave.</p>
```
The value of our style attribute is set using the equals sign `(=)` and enclosed in double quotes `(" ")`. We apply CSS to our HTML tag by setting the value of the style attribute to CSS.
It’s always split into two parts:
- property; the thing you want to change (background-color; height;)
- value; what you want to change it to (red; 200px;)
