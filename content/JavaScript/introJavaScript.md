## Introduction to JavaScript(JS)

___JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to produce dynamic and user-interactive webpages. A huge number of websites and all the latest Internet browsers (clients) use and support JavaScript. It is a part of the stack of technologies that every web developer must learn; these include HTML (the content), CSS (the presentation of content), and JS (behavior of the content when a user interacts with the webpage).___

Previously, the use of JavaScript was just limited to input validations. Now, JS is acknowledged as a fully- edged programming language that is capable of manipulating with complex calculations and deals with all aspects of a client window. JS enhances the webpage by making it more interactive.
