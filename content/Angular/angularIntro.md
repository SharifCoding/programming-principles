## Introduction to Angular

___Angular is a JavaScript open-source client-side framework created and maintained by Google and a community of developers on GitHub. It is written entirely in Typescript, but there is a chance to use vanilla JavaScript version.___

The primary goal of Angular is to simplify the building of client applications in HTML and either JavaScript or in a language such as TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript. The framework consists of several libraries, some of them are core and some optional. The developer writes an Angular application by composing HTML templates with an Angularized mark-up, writing component classes to manage these templates, adding application logic to services, and boxing components and services in modules.

Above figure shows all the major building blocks of the Angular framework. This method of separating HTML templates, component classes that manage the templates, services that contain business logic and other components, leads to logical architectural design, higher component reusability and better testability of separate blocks. This design principle of separation program into distinct parts is well known in computer science as a separation of concerns.
