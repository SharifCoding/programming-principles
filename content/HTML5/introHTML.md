## HyperText Markup Language(HTML)

___HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a language that annotates text. Annotation of text is done using elements.___

HTML is the programming language used by programmers to build websites. It allows you to give your browser instructions. You use HTML to add text and images to a web page. You also use it to group together pieces of information into lines, paragraphs, or sections.

A HTML web page is called a document. It’s made up of HTML elements. Elements are created using small pieces of code called tags. Tags nearly always come in pairs and surround every piece of content on the page. Each tag contains an instruction for your web browser, telling it how to show the element on-screen. This is why HTML is called a “markup language”. You use tags to mark up each piece of content with an instruction for your browser.

#### HTML tags
Each tag is made up of a piece of code surrounded by two angle brackets (< >).
```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```
This is the paragraph `<p>` tag. When tags come in pairs, we call the first tag the opening tag and the second tag the closing tag. You can spot a closing tag because it contains a forward slash `(/)`. When your browser reads this code it understands that you are telling it to group the text between the opening and closing `<p>` tags into a paragraph.
