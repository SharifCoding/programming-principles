## Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption
___Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be.___

#### Authentication
- Used by a server when the server needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site.
- When the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be.
- The user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client.
- Authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password.
- Server giving a certificate to the client in which a trusted third party that the server belongs to the entity that the client expects it to.
- Authentication merely identifies and verifies who the person or system is.
#### Authorization
- Process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file.
- Authorization is usually coupled with authentication so that the server has some concept of who the client is that is requesting access.
- The type of authentication required for authorization may vary; passwords may be required in some cases but not in others.
- Most of the web pages on the Internet require no authentication or authorization.
#### Encryption
- Process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who does not have a decryption key.
- The Secure Shell (SSH) and Socket Layer (SSL) protocols are usually used in encryption processes.
- All data in SSL transactions is encrypted between the client (browser) and the server (web server) before the data is transferred between the two.
- All data in SSH sessions is encrypted between the client and the server when communicating at the shell.
- By encrypting the data exchanged between the client and server can be sent over the Internet with less risk of being intercepted during transit.
